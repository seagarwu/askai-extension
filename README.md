This project is forked from [QuicklyGPT](https://github.com/zealotjin/quicklygpt-extension?tab=readme-ov-file).

The following key enhancements and modifications have been implemented:

- **Revolutionary User Interaction & Context Management:**
    - **Context-Aware Activation:** Ask AI now intelligently integrates into your workflow via the right-click context menu, appearing only when you explicitly choose it, eliminating intrusive automatic pop-ups on text selection.
    - **Flexible Querying:** Directly query AI models using selected text, the current webpage's URL (without text selection), or even by selecting text within an existing Ask AI window to spawn a new, related conversation.
    - **Multi-Model Support:** Seamlessly switch between various advanced AI models (e.g., ChatGPT Turbo, ChatGPT Turbo-16k, Gemini 2.0 Flash) to tailor responses to your needs.

- **Advanced Conversation & Window Management:**
    - **Independent & Continuous Conversations:** Each Ask AI popup window maintains its own distinct and continuous conversation history, allowing for multiple, parallel, and focused dialogues across different Chrome tabs. Questions within a single window are contextually linked.
    - **Dedicated Window Control:** Enjoy full control with support for multiple concurrent Ask AI windows, each with its own independent state. Easily close any window with the 'x' button or by pressing 'Esc'.
    - **Intuitive Window Manipulation:** Move popup windows effortlessly by dragging the top status bar, or for enhanced flexibility, use `Ctrl + Left Click` anywhere on the window to drag.

- **Optimized User Interface & Experience:**
    - **Persistent Input Area:** The input field and send button are now fixed at the bottom of the window, ensuring they are always accessible for continuous conversation, with the chat history scrolling independently above.
    - **Smart Conversation Navigation:** Navigate long conversations with ease using dedicated "Top", "Prev", "Next", and "Bottom" buttons. "Prev" and "Next" precisely locate and display user questions ("You:") at the top of the view.
    - **Streamlined Input & Readability:** Input fields clear automatically with helpful placeholders. Visual separators and enhanced labels improve readability of conversation turns.
    - **Auto-Focus for Immediate Input:** The input field automatically gains focus upon window opening, allowing for immediate text input.
    - **Subtle UI Elements:** Navigation buttons feature a subtle transparency for a less intrusive appearance, and dynamically appear only after the first AI response.
