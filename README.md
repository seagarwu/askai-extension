This project is forked from [QuicklyGPT](https://github.com/zealotjin/quicklygpt-extension?tab=readme-ov-file).

This project was developed using an **AI-assisted, prompt-driven development approach** to rapidly iterate on features and address complex challenges. This methodology allowed for a strong focus on product vision and user experience, demonstrating an agile and innovative development process.

The following enhancements and modifications have been implemented:

- **Dynamic UI and Formatting Improvements:** Addressed issues related to dynamic display box sizing (width/height), input field length adjustments, Markdown rendering, and line break handling.
- **Enhanced User Interaction and Model Selection:** Integrated Ask AI functionality into the right-click context menu for improved user experience (eliminating automatic pop-ups on text selection). Introduced the ability to query without text selection (specifically for URLs). Implemented a dropdown menu for selecting various AI models (e.g., ChatGPT Turbo, ChatGPT Turbo-16k, Gemini 2.0 Flash). Set a default input text of "Please translate to Traditional Chinese."
- **Multi-Window and Window Management:** Enabled support for multiple concurrent query windows. Added a dedicated button for closing individual windows and implemented an Escape key shortcut to close all active windows.
- **Improved Usability:** Automatically focuses the input field upon opening the Ask AI window via right-click, allowing for immediate text input without additional mouse clicks.
